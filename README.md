GPSS-like DSL for AivikaSim

This package allows defining simulation models in terms of a GPSS-like
domain specific language, which can be useful if you are going to
translate your models from GPSS into [Aivika](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika).

Note that the GPSS-like domain specific language is not equivalent to
the original GPSS language, but it may return very similar results in
some cases, while it can also return quite different results in other cases.
